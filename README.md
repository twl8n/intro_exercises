#### intro_exercises
Easy and fun programming intros

These are intend as working introductions to various topics. First is some SQL using sqlite3 which is
pre-installed on many computers.

sql_intro.txt is a terminal session transcript. It is everything I typed, and every response from the computer.

sql_intro_commands.txt are just the commands.

Find your Terminal App (on the Mac, in the dock Apps, utilities folder)

Type in each command, followed by the return key. Backspace works to delete characters.

control-c will often cancel whatever you've typed, as long as you haven't hit the return key.
